üéØ Interview Questions & Answers (Azure DevOps/SRE)
‚úÖ Q1: How do you manage secrets in Azure?
A:
Use Azure Key Vault. Secrets are stored securely and accessed by services via:

Managed Identities

Azure RBAC

Example CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
az keyvault secret show --vault-name myVault --name mySecret
‚úÖ Q2: What is the difference between Azure Monitor and Log Analytics?
A:

Azure Monitor: collects and visualizes metrics and logs.

Log Analytics: query logs using KQL.

Monitor feeds: Metrics, Alerts, Diagnostic Logs.

‚úÖ Q3: How do you configure a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps?
A:

Use Azure Repos for source control.

Define Pipeline YAML or use Classic UI.

Stages: Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Release

Connect to Azure resources via Service Connections or Azure CLI.

‚úÖ Q4: How do you automate Azure VM creation?
A:
Use Terraform, ARM template, or Azure CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
az vm create --resource-group devRG --name devVM --image UbuntuLTS
‚úÖ Q5: How do you handle Azure resource monitoring?
A:

Enable Diagnostic Settings

Collect logs to Log Analytics

Set up Alerts using Action Groups

Dashboard creation in Azure Monitor

‚úÖ Q6: How do you handle incident response in Azure?
A:

Check Azure Service Health

Analyze metrics/logs from Azure Monitor

Use Log Analytics queries

Use Runbooks or Automation to auto-heal (optional)

‚úÖ Q7: What‚Äôs the difference between Azure App Gateway, Load Balancer, and Traffic Manager?
Feature	Azure LB	App Gateway	Traffic Manager
Layer	L4 (TCP/UDP)	L7 (HTTP/HTTPS + WAF)	DNS-level routing
Use Case	Internal LB	SSL Termination, WAF	Geo-based routing
Public IP	Optional	Required	Routes to regional frontends

‚úÖ Q8: How do you manage logs from VMs in Azure?
A:

Install Log Analytics Agent (or AMA).

Connect to Log Analytics workspace.

Use KQL queries like:

kql
Copy
Edit
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
‚úÖ Q9: How do you manage access control in Azure?
A:

Use Azure RBAC via roles: Reader, Contributor, Owner.

Use Azure AD Groups.

Prefer Managed Identity for app/service access.

‚úÖ Q10: How do you perform backup & recovery in Azure?
A:

Use Recovery Services Vault

Enable backup for:

VMs

SQL DBs

File Shares

Schedule backups and set retention policy
